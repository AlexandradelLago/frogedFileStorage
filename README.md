# File Storage System - test 

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed in your system **NodeJS**, **MongoDB**, **ExpressJS**.

### Installing

Download the file go to the back folder and run
```
npm i
```
Then once all dependencies have been installed we are ready to start the backend running either in developer mode (which will change automatically without stopping the server) 
```
npm run watch
```
or production mode.
```
npmr run start
````
### Development server

Now go to the front folder and run again 
```
npm i
```
```
ng serve
```
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
